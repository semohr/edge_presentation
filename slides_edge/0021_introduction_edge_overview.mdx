<Note>

    - First of I will use the term cloud if I talk about centeralized and often shared compute resources. These are not on site and require a internet connection to access.

    - I will use device or edge device to refer to a device that is on site and has a local connection to the local network. These devices can be of highly varring nature, from your vacum robot to an autonomous industrial machines or an arduino microcontroller.

    - As edge or edge infrastructure I will define all compute and storage resources between a device and the cloud. That is for example a local server in your home network or server deployed by the Internet Access Provider which is closer than the cloud to your location.

    Reasoning:

    I'm using these terms this broadly because there is no consensus in the community on how edge is defined. I think every publication I have read has a at least slightly different definiton of edge. I feel like a lot of terms used in this field are mainly coined because they sound new and flashy without introducing a completly new concept.
