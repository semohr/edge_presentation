    I created this figure to make this a bit more clear. Often used in the community is the distinction between edge, fog, cloud and mist. Somteimes with pre or suffix such as compute, infrastructure, device or storage.

    As most articles or publications have a figure showing their system architecture, I could use this information to create this very simplified figure.

    The figure shows a rought representation of how these terms are used, depending on the different publication (here I picked 4 examples in ABC).
    
    
    The number of hops refers to the distance between consumer and producer and where the concept is usally found in a system.

    For instance 
    - in A the very broad definition I want to use is shown. Here we define edge as all the compute infrastructure between a device and the cloud.

    - In some publications devices are also called mist. Or another layer between edge and cloud is introduced this is often called fog. This can be seen in B.

    - I also noticed that the definition of fog and edge is not consistent at all, even thought a majority defines edge closer to the device as in B some swap the two layers. This can be seen in C.

    Overall, I'm not really super happy with all of this tech lingo or these in my opinion "buzzwords". I can understand that introducing new words
    is a way to let your concept stand out more but at least in this context I would argue it decreases accessability and introduces confusion and especially inconsistency. I'm not saying that the concept that stand behind the ideas in each of these pulication is wrong, by no means. I'm just want to make the point that the surrounding lingo is maybe not completly thought threw.

    But nonetheless the idea behind all of this is in my opinion quite interesting and relatable.
