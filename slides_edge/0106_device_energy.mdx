## Edge devices energy consumption

Energy needed for the computation of a task $A(L,\tau,X)$:

$$
E_d = \kappa L X f_d^2 = \kappa \omega f_d^2
$$

<Params>
-   $\kappa$ Device specific constant (Js^2)
-   $f_d$ CPU frequency of device (Hz, 1/s)
-   $\omega$ Number of cpu cycle for task
-   $L$ Data size (byte)
-   $X$ Computational intensity (1/byte)
</Params>

<Note>

The power consumption of a device for a given task is not trivially but it can be shown using circuit theory and experimental validation, that power consumption of a cpu task is roughtly proportional to the frequency squared. 

This is not easy to show but if you are interested in the deriviation you might want to have a look at the Vogeleer paper.

Here we can use again, the number of cpu cycles omega to compute the task and by using this proportionallity we can compute the energy consumption of the device.

In the formula, the kappa constant is device specific. You might need to run some experiments to determine this constant for a specific device. But overall it is just a scaling factor which is not as important as the frequency.
