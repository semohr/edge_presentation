<Note>

The edge computing paradigm is already widely used for web applications. Alot of services allow to rent edge resources. This is used for web applications which need fast response times or real-time data.

Here depending on the location of the request the content and compute is served from the closest edge location. For example Server Side Rendering (SSR) is used to render the content on the edge. This helps to balance load accross the globe, provide localization or rollout features depending on the location and server while still maintaining a single codebase.

There are a number of infrastructure as a service provider e.g. Alibaba Cloud, AWS but most predominant vercel which allow you to deploy web application to a edge network accross the globe.
