<Note>

    Here are my sources, I can recommend X and Y. As you can see there are alot of reviews around. This already tells you alot about the divergence of the field not everyone has the same understanding and ideas about the edge. I dont necessarly think this is a bad thing but Overall
    I have the feeling that getting into this field has a way stepper learningcurce than necessary because of the lack of a common understanding. I think this is a problem that will be solved over time. But for now I think it is important to be aware of this. 

    I hope you know have a rought understanding about the edge and know how to model a simple edge
    infrastructure and build ontop of it to introduce a number of more complex and rigerous models.
