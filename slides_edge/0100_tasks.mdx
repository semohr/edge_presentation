First I want to start with defining a task.

Generally, a task in the edge paradigm can be defined by their input data size, deadline and computational intensity.
Instead of using the number of cycles directly we opt to use the computational intensity which is the number of cycles per byte in the input data. 

We do this because we want to be able to use the same definitons for communication and computation. In communication we need to know the data size to compute e.g. the latency.

As always a programm or application can be split up into a number of tasks which depend on each other. This can be seen as a directed acyclic graphs (DAGs), an example on the right. Here each of these nodes might be a task be offloaded to a server.

Some tasks might not be able to be offloaded. For example, 
- node A might be an input task which can only be executed on the device
- The same might be applied to the last node here e.g. a displaying task might be performed

These specific tasks should not go into the resource orchastration or should not be considered differently.

Here again the important part as we will use it again later is that a Task in the edge paradigm is defined by its input data size, an arbitraty deadline and computational intensity.
