## Short recap

<Params>
- Task $A(L, \tau, X)$
- Latency
    - device $t_d$
    - server $t_s$
    - communication wired $t_c$
    - communication wireless $t_w$
- Energy consumption
    - device $E_d$
    - server $E_s$
    - communication $E_c << E_d \lor E_s$ 
</Params>

<Note>

Let's recap this shortly, so far we have defined:
- The task itself, here we introduced the binary offloading model using the input data size, computational intensity and a arbitrary deadline we have not used so far.
- The latency of the task execution, here we introduced the latency of the device, server and communication.
- The energy consumption of the task execution, here we introduced the energy consumption of the device, server. The energy consumption is normally much smaller than the device or server energy consumption.

Next I want to have a short 5 to 7 min break to discuss or think about the following questions.
