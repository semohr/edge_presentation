<Note>



Even thought the relative **compute** power and **communication** bandwidth has generally increased over
the last years. So have the number of devices connected to the internet.


All of these relationship still follow exponential growth, as you can see in the log scale on the y axis.

As multiple devices share the same communication bandwidth and the number of
devices is increasing at a similar rate as the communication bandwidth, the
communication bandwidth per device stays approximately the same.

Even tho the compute power per device is increasing, the communication bandwidth per device is not.

Thus one could argue communication bandwidth is normally the bottleneck in computing offloading tasks to the cloud.
I think you think back to the mayor example this was also the case.

Thus using a paradigm here called edge which considers the communication bandwidth such as the latency,  might be a good idea for reducing compute time
or establishing more efficient compute.
