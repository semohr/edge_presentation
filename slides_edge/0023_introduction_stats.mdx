<Note>


Even thought the relative **compute** power and **communication** bandwidth has generally increased over
the last years. So have the number of devices connected to the internet.

All of these relationship still follow exponential growth, as you can see in the log scale on the y axis.

As multiple devices share the same communication bandwidth and the number of
devices is increasing at a similar rate as the communication bandwidth, the
communication bandwidth per device stays approximately the same.

Even tho the compute power per device is increasing and thus very likley the data produced by the device,
the communication bandwidth per device is not by the same rate.

Thus one could argue communication bandwidth is normally the bottleneck in computing offloading tasks especially to a datacenters i.e. the cloud.
I think you think back to the mayor example with the city, this was also the case.

Thus considering the communication bandwidth such as the latency, might be a good idea for establishing more efficient compute paradigm.
