### Example (energy constrained)

Single device with limited battery. Thus we want to optimize the
energy consumption of the device.

We offload the task if:
$$
\begin{align*}
E_d &>  &E_c &+ E_i \\
p_d  \frac{\omega}{f_d} &> &p_c\frac{L}{B} &+ p_i \frac{\omega}{f_i}
\end{align*}
$$

<Note>


For instance we might consider a simple system with a single device and edge server. Our device has a limited battery capacity. Here we might offload computations to increase device lifetime. 

Very simple we can just draw a decision boundry. If the Energy needed to compute a task on the device is greater than the energy needed to communicate and the idle energy consumption of the device we offload the task.

We can apply the same approach to latency if this is a concern.
