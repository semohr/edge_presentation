### Example (energy constrained)

Single device with limited battery. Thus we want to optimize the
energy consumption of the device.

We offload the task if:
$$
\begin{align*}
E_d &>  &E_c &+ E_i \\
p_d  \frac{\omega_k}{f_d} &> &p_c\frac{L}{B} &+ p_i \frac{\omega_i}{f_i}
\end{align*}
$$

<Note>


To make this a bit more concrete, we might consider a simple system with a single device and edge server. Our device has a limited battery capacity. Here we might offload computations to increase device lifetime. 

Very simple we just think about our decision boundry. If the Energy needed to compute a task on the device i.e. E_d is greater than the total energy needed to communicate E_c and the idle energy consumption of the device E_i we offload the task.


For instance if we have the power consumptions of the device, server and comunication given this could look like that. Depending on the application and metrics of interest this decision boundry does not have to be this simple and might
include more complex interactions between the device, server and communication.

As another example, we could apply the same approach to latency if this is a concern.
