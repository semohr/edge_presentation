## Edge server energy consumption

Alternative energy consumption model for servers:

$$
E_s = \alpha E_{max} + (1-\alpha) E_{max} u
$$


<Params>
-   $u$ Utilization of server
-   $\alpha$ fraction of idle energy consumption
-   $E_{max}$ Maximum energy consumption of server (J)
</Params>

<Note>
    
    More than for a mobile device the energy consumption of a edge server is jointly determined by the usage of CPU, memory, storage and network interfaces.

    But normally the CPU contriubtion is the dominant among these factors and in first approximation we can again assume that the energy consumption is proportional to the frequency squared. 

    Thus we can just sum all contributions of tasks to get the total energy consumption of the server.

    Alternativly, or other observations have show that server energy consumption is linear to cpu utilization ratio.

    This thus depends on the current load of the server. Additionlly it was observed, that as an idle server still consumes up to 70% of its maximum energy consumption.

    Taking this into account we can introduce a utilization u, a maximum Energy consumption E_max, and a fraction of the idle energy consumption alpha. This gives us an alternative model for the energy consumption of a server which might be more realistic.
