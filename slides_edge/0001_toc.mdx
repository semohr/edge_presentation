<Note>

I have quite a few things planned for today, and hope we can get through them
all.

First I will start with a short motivational example to show why one might want
to use the edge.

Then I will give a brief introduction to the edge, including different
definitions and related concepts.

As my main part today I would like to talk about the moddeling aspect of the
edge. As I have a background in physics this falls right into my area of
interest. Here we will take a look at the computational and communication models
of the edge than we will think about how this can be used to design
resource orchestration algorithms or systems.

I would like to take a take a short 5 min break here to discuss this approach.

Finally I will give you some examples of edge applications and of course a conclusion.
