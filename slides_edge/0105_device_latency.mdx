## Edge devices computational latency


The time it takes to exectute a task $A(L,\tau,X)$ on an edge device can be expressed as:

$$
t_d = \frac{L  X}{f_d} = \frac{\omega}{f_d}
$$


<Params>
-   $f_d$ CPU frequency of device (Hz, 1/s)
-   $\omega$ Number of cpu cycle for task
-   $L$ Data size (byte)
-   $X$ Computational intensity (1/byte)
</Params>

Let's consider devices next. As the main goal of edge computing is to offload tasks from devices we need to define some measures and relationships.

Some tasks might take too long on the device to compute thus we might want to offload them to a server. Generally, the execution time of a task A on a device can be calculated using:

f - cpu frequency of device (Hz, 1/s)

And the task
- L data size (bytes)
- X computational intensity (cyles per byte)


To calculate the time it takes to execute a task on a device we can use this simple formula

Here we take the input size and computational intensity to calculate the number of cpu cycles needed to execute the task. Then we divide this number by the cpu frequency of the device to get the time it takes to execute the task.

On the surface this looks quite easy, but the cpu frequency of a device might not be static or might change depending on the load of the device or the general power conspumption policy. Thus more considerations are needed to get a more accurate measure of the execution time of a task but this is a good first order approximation. One can always add more complexity to the model.

As edge computing is mostly interested in low power and also mobile and/or wireless devices we also need to consider the power consumption of such a device. E.g. a mobile device might not be able to compute a task because of limited battery capacity. 

Here we dont want to manually change the battery often, thus minimizing the power consumption or maximizing the lifetime of such a device has some priority.
