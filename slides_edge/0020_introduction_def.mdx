<Note>
    There is no standard definition or norm that defines the edge or edge computing, it is more of a concept or idea.
    Generally speaking, edge computing is a distributed computing paradigm that brings computation and data storage closer to the location where it is needed and used.
    
    In the following I will use the terms very broadly, as this term is used very inconsisten throughout literature.
