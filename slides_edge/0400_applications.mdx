<Note>

The idea here is to have two kind of edge servers. Base stations which are accessability from great distance and road side units which are deployed near intersection or other locations, where autonomous cars are most likely to make decisions.

Here the edge servers also act as middleware between edge devices and the cloud.

Take note of the notation again. Here the short form edge is defined as the edge device and not the edge server.
