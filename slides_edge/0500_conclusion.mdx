<Note>
    Edge is a paradigm catering to the growth of data producers and it brings compute and closer to the data.

    Overall the lingo might be a bit inconsistent but the ideas behind the 
    different terms are often interesting and sometimes even novel concepts. But it is hard to distingush them just by the name.

    I also hope that you got a bit of insight on how I approach a new topic by modeling the components.

    I am looking forward to your feedback and I hope you enjoyed the presentation.
