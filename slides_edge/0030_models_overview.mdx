## Components of the edge infrastructure


-   Tasks
-   Device compute
-   Server compute
-   Communication
-   Resource orchestration

<Note>

When trying to understand any new topic I try to approach the topic by splitting it into their essential parts and understand
them individually before considerng the bigger picture.

For edge, I identified five main components which need to be understood, in order to get an idea of what edge is about in general.

These components are:

-   Tasks i.e. computations that need to be performed and their characteristics
-   Device compute aspect i.e. the compute capabilities of the devices
-   Server compute aspect i.e. the compute capabilities of servers and what characterizes server in comparison to devices
-   Communication aspect i.e. how devices and servers communicate with
    each other
-   Resource orchestration i.e. what criteria(s) can be used to decide which task
    should be performed on which device. This brings all of the previous
    components together.

First I want to start with defining a task.
